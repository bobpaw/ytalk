	  <Maragakis@mpq.mpg.de> following hints by Jason Gunthorpe

version 3.1.1
	New features:
	* YTalk now checks that connections are answered from the expected host;
	  if they aren't, it complains and shows the new hostname

	  include a '.'

version 3.1
	* Minor documentation updates

version 3.1beta2

	New features:
	* Added -Y to ask for caps in yes/no questions
	* Added -i to leave the incoming talks to the daemon
	* Added the 'k' option to the main menu (kill all unconnected)
	* Made ESC[r in shells
	* Added the /dev/ptmx style of pty's, and some Solaris-specific code to
	  go with it
	* 8 bit clean (except for character 0xfe, which is the lower case
	  Icelandic thorn, b/c that is used as the delete char in ytalk, for
	  some reason)
	* Added aliases for whole addresses, hostnames and login names
	* Let the user save his own side of the conversation too
	* Support virtual hosts and multihomed machines, by letting the user pick
	  which interface to use, and otherwise making a guess at it

	Changes:
	* Avoid clearing the window when the last partner ^C's on you
	* Fixed line wrap inside shells (at the cost of breaking the specs in
	  term.doc slightly)
	* Always understood both ^h and delete (^?) as delete chars
	* Split the "auto-rering" flag into "rering" and "prompt-rering"
	* Made ytalk send out FQDN's when passing users around, so the other
	  machine has a chance to resolve the address
	* Use strerror() instead of sys_errlist, where available
	* Redefine our own sockaddr_in, since BSD4.4 (and FreeBSD and friends)
	  use a different definition from what the talk daemons expect
	* Ported to GNU Autoconf

	Bug fixes:
	* Fixed annoying bug with UDP handling under Linux (that's where the
	  spurious "no talk daemon" messages were coming from!)
